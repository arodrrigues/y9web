	<h1>Explanation & Justification</h1>
        <h3>Explanation i. </h3>
<h4>For others to be intrigued and feel the need to focus a product must be desirable and pleasing to the eye. Data must be manipulated and embellished to ensure others pay attention to the important cause whatever it may be. Human beings these days have a limited attention span with technology allowing for quick alternatives.  You have to be able to capture the eye of one within the first few seconds. Aspects such as bright colours and interesting images do such in a prevalent way. </h4>

        <h3>Justification  i.</h3>
            
<h4>Wrangled data surrounding the topic of accidental poisoning through a json file from the World Health Organization provides the base for awareness to be created. As this data spans over twenty thousand lines of code, respectively no individual would feel intrigued to look through it all. Thus the need to create a vibrant interesting website in which others may come to to further their understanding of the subject and look for a solution. The use of charts and other graphical devices provides a base for presenting clean data. </h4>

        <h3>Client/Target i.</h3>
            
<h4>The clientele in which my html website is aimed towards is others who may be aware of the topic of accidental poisoning through pollution and may be limited within the technology field, thus my website comes into play presenting well organized data in which can be viewed and processed. 
 </h4>

    <h1>Primary research / Skills</h1>
    <h4>To virtually fulfill the creation of a well organized html website through the use of json data many technological skills revolving around html, css, and java must be in play to make it a reality. For example a web tech device I would like to research and learn about is the use of links to open new web pages attached to the main one. Another Online technological bit I would need to fulfil my web0age would be the use of graphing and charting through css. Through research I have been able to envelop a css resource in which teaches one to graph data through code. This website located at <a href='https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/'>https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/</a> outlines the ability to create charts and graphs through css. The final main technological tool I would need to fill my arsenal would be the use of buttons as well through css. This would allow the user to sift through the webpage only clicking on/choosing their desired topics to enhance the user experience of accessibility of data within my webpage. The use of buttons can be found at<a href=    'https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp'>    https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp</a>. I believe the use of charts and graphs is the most important skill followed by buttons and then links. Although only 3 web technologies have been outlined through the second string of criterion A, there are many other factors in which will create my website to make it a success. </h4>

    <h1>Inspirational Range of products</h1>
    <h4>The first secondary resource as a website in which I will analyse is the Nation Poison Statistics off or the Poison.org website. This website is able to provide accurate statistics in a somewhat visually pleasing method. The majority of the site consists of stating statistics with a minimal amount of figures such as graphs and charts. The upside of this chart consists of its use of vibrant intriguing colours in which draw in the viewer. Another upside is the range in type of figure which is in use from 3d pie chart to a standard bar graph. This allows a different approach or perspective in the which viewers can interpret the data for themselves. Although this may be seen as an upside it may also confuse the audience and lose the simplistic approach in which others like. The downside of this website is the bland approach to respective placing of figures and paragraphs. The entire site is figure after paragraph after figure repeat on and on in a vertical order. There is no horizontal stylistic approach in placing graphs beside each other to compare or providing a larger amount of information in a refined space. Overall this website does a relatively good job interpreting charts with intriguing colours and options, but lacks the strategic and stylistic planning. </h4>

    <h4>Although this resource may not surround the category of poisoning, it does display a good example of organizing statistics into a webpage using html and css. The second website in which I chose to analyze is NBA.com/Stats. I believe this website does a fairly poor job of presenting data and statistics in an interesting way. This webpage lacks figures, photos or even a analysis of the statistics. This may be due to the subject it revolves around or what the clientele prefers but for a data presentation standpoint this webpage is not up to par with my standards. The one positive in which I analyzed is the use of javascript to alter many variables in which the statics will respond to respectively. This allows the user to have a personalized experience. Overall this website lacks the beauty and intrigue through css but reasonably makes up for it with it's extent use of javascript to create an interactive experience. </h4>

    <h4>The third and final product in which I will analyze is a web page revolving around ‘The Average Web Page’. This website found on css-tricks.com analyzes over 8 million websites and presents the data in which is found in a presentable intriguing manor. I believe this website is relative to what I am personally aiming for with my project although this webpage may be a little advanced. This websites checks off all the boxes for me; strategic placing, stylistic, figures, colouring, paragraphs, everything. The use of headers and figures with the placement of analyzing paragraphs in between create a very user friendly productive environment. The colours and use of symbols and graphs catch the users attention and provide a simplistic way to analyze the data individually and personally. The use of space is very strategic using the full lengths of the webpage to portray the data.  </h4>

    <h1>Design Brief</h1>
    <h4>	The problem in which needs a solution is the reconfigurations and presentation fo hard statistical data in the form of a json file in which surrounds the topic of accidental poisoning found on the World Health organization website. An overview of why is this is important is to get the attention of the audience through stylistic choices.

	The solution to this problem will be created through a independently designed and created online webpage using the foundations of css and html. The website will be coded locally then presented on the world wide web through github pages. This solution is justified because of the ability for anyone to view it. If another solution such as a poster or video was chosen, only a select few could view the data. This does not satisfy the cause and the attention in which accident posing should receive. Another reason why this is justified is due to the ability for html to process and transform the data into adequate reasonable statistics in which can be use and turned into graphical elements. 
</h4>
   
 <h2>Overview of Analyzation</h2>
        
    <h4> 	As outlined in strand ii. The basic skills I believe I will need to use to design and create a graphical website in which presents data stylistically, all fall under the categories of css and html. All these skills were discovered through the use of primary research throughout this project. The first skill is the use of links through html, this will allow me to portray more information through multiple web pages all connected to one single homepage. The second skill is the ability to transform data into figures such as charts and graphs. This will transform my webpage into an intriguing stylistic representation of the data. It will also allow viewers to interpret the data at their own level. The third skill relates to the use of buttons through css. This is mostly for the use of users to create a specific individual experience in allowing viewers to select their own variables in which the webpage manipulates and performs adequately to show in a respective manner. </h4>
        
        
        <h4>	Throughout my research of secondary resources I have developed a summary of what I have been able to find. To start I intend to stay away from the simplistic vertical layout in which the first webpage I analyzed used. This proves boring to the viewer. As the first and third resource portrayed, I intend to include the use of graphs and other figures within my webpage. This allows for a creator user experience and a more intriguing website. I also intending on using a softer variety of fonts and colours such as comic sans, and the light colours of reds and blues. My takeaway from the second webpages revolves around the use of buttons and javascript to present and range of underlying statistics and information at the click of a button. This creates a more personal and individualized experience for users. </h4>
