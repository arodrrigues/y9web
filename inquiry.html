	<h1>Explanation & Justification</h1>
    <h4>For others to be intrigued and feel the need to focus a product must be desirable and pleasing to the eye. Data must be manipulated and embellished to ensure others pay attention to the important cause whatever it may be. Wrangled data surrounding the topic of accidental poisoning through a json file from the World Health Organization provides the base for awareness to be created. As this data spans over twenty thousand lines of code, respectively no individual would feel intrigued to look through it all. Thus the need to create a vibrant interesting website in which others may come to to further their understanding of the subject and look for a solution. The use of charts and other graphical devices provides a base for presenting clean data. The clientele in which my html website is aimed towards is others who may be aware of the topic of accidental poisoning through pollution and may be limited within the technology field, thus my website comes into play presenting well organized data in which can be viewed and processed. </h4>

    <h1>Primary research / Skills</h1>
    <h4>To virtually fulfill the creation of a well organized html website through the use of json data many technological skills revolving around html, css, and java must be in play to make it a reality. For example a web tech device I would like to research and learn about is the use of links to open new web pages attached to the main one. Another Online technological bit I would need to fulfil my web0age would be the use of graphing and charting through css. Through research I have been able to envelop a css resource in which teaches one to graph data through code. This website located at <a href='https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/'>https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/</a> outlines the ability to create charts and graphs through css. The final main technological tool I would need to fill my arsenal would be the use of buttons as well through css. This would allow the user to sift through the webpage only clicking on/choosing their desired topics to enhance the user experience of accessibility of data within my webpage. The use of buttons can be found at<a href=    'https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp'>    https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp</a>. I believe the use of charts and graphs is the most important skill followed by buttons and then links. Although only 3 web technologies have been outlined through the second string of criterion A, there are many other factors in which will create my website to make it a success. </h4>
