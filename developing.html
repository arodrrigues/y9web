    <h1> Chosen Design </h1>
            <h3> I have chosen to create my webpage surrounding the fundametals and structure of design 2. The Dual Pannel Webpage allows for a very easy understand informational webpage in which my directed personeel will be able to understand and work with. The ability to have two different sources of data side by side allows the user to refer toe ach to ensure full understanding. This allow increases interest without the need to scroll down. Above the dual pannels lays a row in which users can look through a pulldown menu to find their prefered country. Once they have found their country all they have to do is type in the name to generate a graph and numerical data. In addition if more information is needed by the user a second dearch bar will redirect you to an external infromation site about the coutry. Design 2 allows all my design criteria to be met if created properly. Another reason I chose design 2 is by peer decision making. I explained both diagrams to friends and family members and discovered that design 2 won by popular vote. I believe this design allows me to create my ideal webpage following my succes criteria and ideal audience appropriately.

            <h2> Stage 1 - Within this stage I will create the html structure for my webpage, this includes opening Brackets, and creating a new file with an html tag. This stage outlines the very basics to creating a webpage.</h2>
            
            <h2> Stage 2 - This stage includes the styling and looks for the website. These are designed through css using the style tags. Within this stage I will implant a background colour for my body and decide on fonts and font colurs for my webpage. Style will also allow me to format where each section, paragraph, button or graph will be placed on a layout standpoint. </h2>\
            
            <h2> Satge - 3 Stage 3 allows me to interpret the json file and data within. This will allow me to easily acces the data and present it numerically or graphically. This interpretation allows me to sift through more than 50,000 lines of code and pin point and extract the exact data needed. </h2>
            
            <h2> Stage 4 - Stage 4 outlines the use of javascript to create a user personalized experience. This stage is where the buttons come to life. With the use of javascript words typed into a search bar or buttons clicked will act accordingly and present interpreted data from the json file. </h2>
